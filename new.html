            <p>The timing gears form important

            <p>In order to ensure ideal lubrication
                and excellent durability, the
                bearings located on either
                end are splash oil lubricated.
                Depending on atmospheric and
                operation conditions, the oil baths
                have cooling arrangements for
                preventing its deterioration. The
                forced lubrication (L) is provided
                for high pressure blowers and on
                request.</p>

            <p>..................</p>
            <p>Since the lobes run without
                contact, the mechanical power
                loss is determined by the friction
                of ball and roller bearings and
                of timing gears. The gears being
                helical, hardened and ground to
                high accuracy and with antifriction
                bearings, the mechanical power
                loss is thus reduced to bare
                minimum</p>
