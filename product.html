                The suction & discharge flanges
                are standardized as per IS-8418.
                Depending on application, the

                have cooling arrangements for

            <h2>HIGH MECHANICAL EFFICIENCY:</h2>

            <p>Since the lobes run without
                contact, the mechanical power
                loss is determined by the friction
                of ball and roller bearings and
                of timing gears. The gears being
                helical, hardened and ground to
                high accuracy and with antifriction
                bearings, the mechanical power
                loss is thus reduced to bare
